For example, the way the assets are encoded in Move is different than it has been traditionally done as far as I understand. Every time you create in Move, you essentially create an NFT with all the rich properties that you can modify. Move has been designed around this concept of being able to share code easily, which is why we integrated this concept of packages and modules. This allows you to write and publish source code somewhere that people kind of know what they're seeing on the chain, but then you don't have to copy and paste.
